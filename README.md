# winsecurelog
Secondary security gateway for Windows systems.
This script adds a secondary layer of security to your system.

# Usage
1) Edit the Protection.bat for set the password.
2) Run the Setup.bat

Now, a second password will be requested each time a login is logged. If nothing is done, the system will shut down for 15 seconds. If the password is entered incorrectly, you will be logged out. If the password is entered correctly, the system shutdown will be cancelled.
